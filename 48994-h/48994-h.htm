<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In writing a prefatory note to an American
reprint of this notable address there
are three things to consider&mdash;the writer,
his subject, and the occasion. The greatly
beloved author had a multitude of friends
in all lands, and far abler pens have written
much concerning him during the past twelve
months. The subject is one of no less moment
on this side of the Atlantic than to those
in older countries who concern themselves
with scholarship and education, though
here the classicists are having a particularly
hard struggle to retain in our academies,
schools, and colleges a proper footing for
the ancient languages and learning termed
&quot;the humanities.&quot; The circumstances under
which the address was given are less
familiar in this country than the author
and his subject, for we as yet have no corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[pg&nbsp;vi]</span>
organization, or at least none
with such an ambitious programme. Consequently
it is appropriate that this note
should dwell chiefly upon the occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">The Classical Association, composed of
a large body of university men, teachers,
and schoolmasters, with local branches in
several places in Great Britain and her colonies,
was established in 1904 with this
object:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">To promote the development and maintain the
well-being of classical studies and in particular:</p>

<p class="indent">(a) To impress upon public opinion the claim of
such studies to an eminent place in the national
scheme of education;</p>

<p class="indent">(b) To improve the practice of classical teaching
by free discussion of its scope and methods;</p>

<p class="indent">(c) To encourage investigation and call attention
to new discoveries;</p>

<p class="indent">(d) To create opportunities for friendly intercourse
and co-operation among all lovers of
classical learning in this country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">That Sir William Osler should have been
chosen to preside over such an assembly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii" id="pagevii"></a>[pg&nbsp;vii]</span>
British scholars is no matter for surprise,
for though a humanist in the broad sense
of the term as a student of human affairs
and human nature, rather than of Latin and
Greek, he at the same time was a wide reader
with a &quot;relish for knowledge,&quot; successful
not only in its quest in many fields beyond
that of his chosen profession, but particularly
so in his ability to hand his literary
gleanings on to others in a new and attractive
form. Nevertheless, the presidency of
the Classical Association, considering the
avowed objects of this body, was a most signal
honour in view of his reputation primarily
as a scientist and teacher of medicine.</p>

<p class="indent">His immediate predecessor, the Professor
of Greek at Christ Church, opened his
presidential address of the year before with
these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">It is the general custom of this Association to
choose as its President alternately a classical scholar
and a man of wide eminence outside the classics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;viii]</span>
Next year you are to have a man of science, a great
physician who is also famous in the world of learning
and literature. Last year you had a statesman,
who, though a statesman, is also a great scholar
and man of letters, a sage and counsellor in the
antique mould, of world-wide fame and unique
influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Thus, though in himself sufficiently representative
of humanistic culture, Osler was
in this strict sense an alternate, and among
the fourteen earlier Presidents of the Association
three had like himself been Fellows
of the Royal Society, which long since had
abandoned even the pretence of concerning
itself with classical studies which had
been the very basis of the Revival of Learning.</p>

<p class="indent">The list of Presidents since the foundation
of the Association may be a matter of
interest to those in this country who may
not have been aware of the existence and
purposes of this organization of British
scholars:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix" id="pageix"></a>[pg&nbsp;ix]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">1904. The Right Hon. Sir R. H. Collins, M.A.,
LL.D., D.C.L., Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p class="indent">1905. The Right Hon. the Earl of Halsbury,

of Archæology, Cambridge.</p>

<p class="indent">1915. Sir W. B. Richmond, K.C.B., R.A.,
D.C.L.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg&nbsp;x]</span>
1916. The Right Hon. Viscount Bryce, O.M.,
D.C.L., LL.D., P.B.A., F.R.S.</p>

<p class="indent">1917. Professor Gilbert Murray, LL.D., D.Litt.,
F.B.A., F.R.S.L., Christ Church, Oxford.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">As reported in the Annual Proceedings
of the Association, Professor Murray at the
meeting in 1918, in nominating his successor,
spoke of him as a man, &quot;who is not
only one of the most eminent physicians in
the world, but represents in a peculiar way
the learned physician who was one of the
marked characters of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, and stands for a type
of culture which the Classical Association
does not wish to see die out of the world&mdash;the
culture of a man who, while devoting
himself to his special science, keeps nevertheless
a broad basis of interest in letters of
all kinds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In seconding this proposal, Sir Frederic
Kenyon pointed out that it had come at a
very appropriate time in the work of the Association,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xi]</span>
for: &quot;During this last year our
main activity has been directed towards getting
representatives of Natural Science and
of the Humanities to work together, on the
principle that those subjects never should
be in conflict with one another, but merely
in friendly competition. Both are equally essential
for a liberal education. It is a continuation
and a symbol of that policy that we
should ask Sir William Osler to become our
President, and that he should have accepted
cordially and readily, as he did. He is
eminent as a man of science, is President of
the Bibliographical Society, and represents
scholarship in medicine in its best form.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It is quite possible that these last remarks
may have suggested to the succeeding President
an appropriate topic for his address,
for he told the writer a few months later that
he planned to talk on Science and the Humanities.
He was already turning the matter
over in his mind, but where he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xii]</span>
time or inclination to write the address it is
difficult to imagine.</p>

<p class="indent">Staggered by the loss of his son, an only
child, who had fallen in action near St. Julien
during the Passchendaele battles in September
the year before, his days occupied
with a succession of duties in connection
with the war, his household filled as always
with friends and visitors innumerable, and
every young American or Canadian in service
in England gravitating there, eager
above all things to further the progress of
the elaborate catalogue of his unique and
valuable collection of books, he nevertheless
set himself to prepare this, one of his most
brilliant and what proved to be his last formal
address.</p>

<p class="indent">The meeting of the Association was to
be held in Oxford, the bed-rock of classical
learning&mdash;the only place, it seems, where
the word &quot;humanism&quot; in its narrow sense
still survives in modern university terminology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xiii]</span>
as that part of the curriculum known
as <i>Litteræ Humaniores</i>. As was characteristic
of his methods, the mere address itself
did not suffice, but he prepared for the
occasion in other ways. Thus he collected
from the various Oxford colleges and placed
on exhibition an array of historical objects
illustrating the important part Oxford had
once played in science and natural philosophy
in days antedating the Royal Society
which had its seeds of origin there. In addition,
and as a possible offset to this, he
exhibited from his own collection of books
those volumes which constituted in their
original editions the outstanding classics in
Science and Medicine. A small pamphlet
concerning them reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Faced with a bewildering variety and ever-increasing
literature, how is the hard-pressed student
to learn&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">1. The evolution of knowledge in any subject;</p>

<p class="indent">2. The life and work of the men who made the
original contributions?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xiv]</span>
So far as concerns Science and Medicine, an
attempt is made to answer the question by the collection
of a Bibliotheca Prima, examples from
which are here shown. The idea is to have in a
comparatively small number of works the essential
literature grouped about the men of the first rank,
arranged in chronological order.</p>

<p class="indent">I have put out the <i>editiones principes</i> of twenty
of such works. The fundamental contribution may
be represented by a great Aldine edition, <i>e.g.</i> Aristotle,
by the brief communication such as that of
Darwin and Wallace in the Proceedings of the
Linnean Society, 1858, or by a three-page pamphlet
of Roentgen. From the card lists of Galen,
Hippocrates, Vesalius, and Harvey, those interested
will see the aim and scope of the collection.</p>

<p class="indent">The works on exhibition are:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Plato  1513</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hippocrates  1526</span><br />
<span class="i0">Aristotle  1495-98</span><br />
<span class="i0">Theophrastus  1483</span><br />
<span class="i0">Galen  1525</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dioscorides  1499</span><br />
<span class="i0">Celsus  1478</span><br />
<span class="i0">Plotinus  1492</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rhazes  1476</span><br />

</blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv" id="pagexv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xv]</span>
Though it is hardly pertinent to this introductory
note, the temptation is strong to
dwell further on the treasures of his library.
These mentioned above were but samples
from the Bibliotheca Prima, and the superb
collection, with copious notes on each separate
item, is further subdivided into some
seven sections&mdash;Bibliotheca Secunda, historica,
biographica, literaria, the incunabulas,
and so on.</p>

<p class="indent">He was for seven years President of the
Bibliographical Society and as great a lover
of books as of men, but it should be borne
in mind that his library was being collected
and catalogued, not as a series of treasures
by reason of their rarity, but were regarded
as instruments for the advancement of
knowledge, and with this end in view the
collection was bequeathed to McGill University.</p>

<p class="indent">By good fortune, letters which give interesting
descriptions of the effect of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi" id="pagexvi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xvi]</span>
address have been received from two distinguished
members of Sir William&#39;s audience,
one of them an eminent classical
scholar, the other an eminent scientist. Sir
Frederic Kenyon writes that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The delivery of Sir William Osler&#39;s address
was a very memorable occasion. As can be seen
by those who read it, it was full of learning, of
humour, of feeling, of eloquence, and it contained
suggestions of real weight with regard to the interconnection
of science and the humanities. But it
gained much in delivery from the personality of
the speaker. No one could hear it without being
impressed by his width of outlook, by his easy
mastery of great tracts of literature and learning,
by his all-embracing humanity in the widest sense
of the term. I hope it made many students of science
anxious to extend their knowledge of classical
literature; I know it made one student of the classics
wish that he had a wider knowledge of natural
science. Osler himself was a well-nigh perfect example
of the union of science and the humanities,
which to some of us is the ideal of educational
progress; and his address embodied the whole
spirit of this ideal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvii" id="pagexvii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xvii]</span>
Professor William H. Welch has given
the following account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Most fortunately for me my last visit to the
Oslers&#39; in Oxford happened to be on Friday, May
16, 1919, when Osler delivered his presidential
address before the Classical Association.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the many honours which came to Osler few
gave him so great pleasure, as well as surprise, as
his election to the presidency of the British Classical
Association. This was a recognition, not merely
of his sympathetic interest in classical studies and
intimate association with classical scholars, but
also of his mastery of certain phases of the subject,
especially the bibliographical and historical sides,
and the relation of the work and thought of classical
antiquity to the development of medicine, science,
and culture. There have been physicians,
especially in England, well known for their attainments
as classical scholars, but I am not aware that
since Linacre there has come to a member of the
medical profession distinction in this field comparable
to Osler&#39;s election to the presidency of the
British Classical Association.</p>

<p class="indent">Osler told me that he had never given so much
time and thought to the preparation of an address
as he did to this one. The occasion and the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii" id="pagexviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xviii]</span>
setting were to me most interesting and impressive.
At noon the audience of distinguished scholars
and guests assembled in the &quot;Divinity Room,&quot;
the most beautiful assembly room in Oxford. At
one end of the hall the Vice-Chancellor of the
University presided and halfway down one of the
sides was the high seat of the orator. The distinguished
company, the brightly coloured academic
gowns and hoods, the traditional ceremonies for
such an occasion in Oxford, the figure of Osler himself,
the charm and interest of the address and its cordial
appreciation and reception by the audience,
all combined to make a scene of brilliancy and delight
which I shall always carry in my memory.</p>

<p class="indent">At the close of the address the vote of thanks
was moved by Sir Herbert Warren, the President
of Magdalen College, who described Osler as the
modern Galen, and was seconded by Sir John Barran,
the member of Parliament from Leeds, in
felicitous words of discriminating praise of the
President&#39;s address. The audience responded most
enthusiastically.</p>

<p class="indent">I shall never forget the hour which I spent with
Osler just before the address, in inspecting the wonderful
collection of scientific instruments of historical
interest which Mr. Gunther had assembled
at Osler&#39;s request from the various colleges at Oxford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexix" id="pagexix"></a>[pg&nbsp;xix]</span>
especially from Merton, the old home of
science. An interesting descriptive catalogue of the
collection had been prepared. With what delight
Osler showed me and told me the histories and associations
of the astrolabes, armillary spheres, orreries,
telescopes, lenses, microscopes, books, etc.,
which he had caused to be gathered together in
connection with the meeting of the Classical
Association! You will recognize a characteristic
touch and thought of Osler in arranging for
such an original exhibit to interest a meeting of
scholars.</p>

<p class="indent">When not long after the address I said good-bye
to Osler I little thought that it was to be our
final parting, but I rejoice to have been with him
then and to remember him as I saw him last on
that triumphal day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Thus, though from first to last his heart
was wrapped up in his profession and its
science, his mind was open to other things,
and his confession that the <i>Religio Medici</i>
was the second book he ever purchased and
that the particular copy had always remained
at his bedside is not without significance.
He lived to prove himself, not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexx" id="pagexx"></a>[pg&nbsp;xx]</span>
a worthy disciple of those scholars of the
Renascence who interested themselves in
natural philosophy, but also of those who
were devotees of the ancient languages and
literature. But Sir William Osler was a man
first&mdash;a physician and scholar afterward;
and beneath his high spirits, his love of fun,
lay an infinite compassion and tenderness
toward his humankind. &quot;Write me as one
who loves his fellow-men.&quot; And upon few
men has such a measure of admiration, affection,
and love been bestowed in return.
These things he bore without pride, as he
bore his great success in life with humility.</p>

<p class="indent">On July 12, 1919, less than two months
after the address was delivered, he attained
his seventieth year, and was presented with
two volumes containing sixty-seven original
&quot;Contributions to Medical and Biological
Research&quot; written in his honour.
In addition to this, tributes were showered
upon him from all sides, and his work, character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi" id="pagexxi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxi]</span>
and accomplishments became the
subject of papers innumerable. It was an
extraordinary outburst, one of those exceptional
occurrences when people do not wait
for the passing&mdash;in this case so near at hand&mdash;to
say, what is in their hearts to say, of
the life of a friend. A brief characterization
of him from one of the most eminent of British
scholars was quoted early in this note,
and it may be fitting to close with some lines
by the dean of American classical scholars,
Basil L. Gildersleeve, written for what
proved to be his last birthday:</p>

<h2>THE OLD HUMANITIES AND<br />
THE NEW SCIENCE</h2>

<h2>I</h2>

<p class="indent">Early in the sixteenth century a literary
joke sent inextinguishable laughter
through the learned circles of Europe.
The <i>Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum</i> is great
literature, to which I refer for two reasons&mdash;its
standard is an exact gauge of my
scholarship, and had <i>Magister Nostrandus
Ortuinus Gratius</i> of Cologne, to whom most
of the letters are addressed, been asked to
join that wicked Erfurt Circle, he could not
have been more surprised than I was to receive
a gracious invitation to preside over
this gathering of British scholars. I felt to
have been sailing under false colours to
have ever, by pen or tongue, suggested the
possession of even the traditional small Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
and less Greek. Relieved by the assurance
that in alternate years the qualification
of your President was an interest in education
and literature, I gladly accepted, not,
however, without such anticipatory qualms
as afflict an amateur at the thought of addressing
a body of experts. Not an educated
man in the Oxford sense, yet faint
memories of the classics linger&mdash;the result
of ten years of such study as lads of
my generation pursued, memories best expressed
in Tom Hood&#39;s lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;The weary tasks I used to con!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The hopeless leaves I wept upon!</span><br />
<span class="i2">Most fruitless leaves to me!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In a life of teaching and practice, a mere
picker-up of learning&#39;s crumbs is made to
realize the value of the humanities in science
not less than in general culture.</p>

<p class="indent">To have a Professor of Medicine in this
Chair gives to the Oxford meeting an appropriate
renaissance&mdash;shall we say mediæval?&mdash;flavour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
and one may be pardoned
the regret that the meeting is not being held
in May, 1519, to have had the pleasure of
listening to an address from a real Oxford
scholar-physician, an early teacher of Greek
in this University, and the founder of the
Royal College of Physicians, whose <i>Rudimenta
Grammatices</i> and <i>De Emendata Structura
Latini Sermonis</i> upheld for a generation,
on the Continent at least, the reputation
of English scholarship. These noble walls,
themselves an audience&mdash;indeed, most
appreciative of audiences&mdash;have storied
memories of Linacre&#39;s voice, and the basis
of the keen judgment of Erasmus may have
been formed by intercourse with him in this
very school. In those happy days, to know
Hippocrates and Galen was to know disease
and to be qualified to practise; and my profession
looks back in grateful admiration to
such great medical humanists as Linacre
and Caius and Rabelais. Nor can I claim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
to speak for pure science, some salt of which
remains from early association, and from a
lifelong attempt to correlate with art a science
which makes medicine, I was going
to say the only&mdash;but it is more civil to say
the most&mdash;progressive of the learned professions.</p>

<p class="indent">To have lived right through an epoch,
matched only by two in the story of the
race, to have shared in its long struggle, to
have witnessed its final victory (and in my
own case, to be left I trust with wit enough
to realize its significance)&mdash;to have done
this has been a wonderful privilege. To
have outgrown age-old theories of man and
of nature, to have seen west separated from
east in the tangled skein of human thought,
to have lived in a world re-making&mdash;these
are among the thrills and triumphs of the
Victorian of my generation. To a childhood
and youth came echoes of the controversy
that Aristarchus began, Copernicus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
continued, and Darwin ended, that put
the microcosm into line with the macrocosm,
and for the golden age of Eden substituted
the <i>tellus dura</i> of Lucretius. Think of
the Cimmerian darkness out of which our
generation has, at any rate, blazed a path!
Picture the mental state of a community
which could produce &quot;Omphalos: An Attempt
to untie the Geological Knot&quot;!<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
I heard warm clerical discussions on its
main thesis, that the fossils were put into
the earth&#39;s strata to test men&#39;s faith in the
Mosaic account of the creation, and our
Professor of Natural Theology lectured seriously
upon it! The intellectual unrest of
those days wrapped many in that &quot;dyvine
cloude of unknowynge,&quot; by which happy
phrase Brother Herp designates mediæval
mysticism; and not a bad thing for a young
man to live through, as sufficient infection
usually remains to enable him to understand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
if not to sympathize with, mental
states alien or even hostile.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">An Age of Force followed the final subjugation
of Nature. The dynamo replaced
the steam-engine, radiant energy revealed
the hidden secrets of matter, to the conquest
of the earth was added the control of
the air and the mastery of the deep. Nor
was it only an Age of Force. Never before
had man done so much for his brother, the
victory over the powers of Nature meant
also glorious victories of peace; pestilences
were checked, the cry of the poor became
articulate, and to help the life of the submerged
half became a sacred duty of the
other. How full we were of the pride of life!
In 1910 at Edinburgh I ended an address
on &quot;Man&#39;s Redemption of Man&quot; with
the well-known lines of Shelley beginning,
&quot;Happiness and Science dawn though late
upon the earth.&quot; And now, having survived
the greatest war in history, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
great victory, with the wreckage of mediæval
autonomy to clear up, our fears are
lest we may fail to control the fretful forces
of Caliban, and our hopes are to rebuild Jerusalem
in this green and pleasant land.</p>

<p class="indent">Never before in its long evolution has the
race realized its full capacity. Our fathers
have told us, and we ourselves have known,
of glorious sacrifices; but the past four
years have exhausted in every direction the
possibilities of human effort. And, as usual,
among the nations the chief burden has
fallen on that weary Titan, the Motherland,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Bearing on shoulders immense,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Atlantean, the load</span><br />
<span class="i0">Well-nigh not to be borne</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the too vast orb of her fate.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Not alone did she furnish the sinews of
war, but she developed a spirit that made
defeat impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">No wonder war has advocates, to plead
the heroic clash of ideals, the purging of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
nation&#39;s dross in the fire of suffering and
sacrifice, and the welding in one great
purpose of a scattered people. Even Montaigne,
sanest of men, called it &quot;the greatest
and most magnificent of human actions&quot;;
and the glamours of its pride,
pomp, and circumstance still captivate. But
there are other sides which we should face
without shrinking. Why dwell on the horrors
such as we doctors and nurses have had
to see? Enough to say that war blasts the
soul, and in this great conflict the finer
sense of humanity has been shocked to
paralysis by the helplessness of our civilization
and the futility of our religion to
stem a wave of primitive barbarism. Black
as are the written and unwritten pages of
history, the concentrated and prolonged
martyrdom surpasses anything man has
yet had to endure. What a shock to the
proud and mealy-mouthed Victorian who
had begun to trust that Love was creation&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
final law, forgetting that Egypt and Babylon
are our contemporaries and of yesterday
in comparison with the hundreds of
thousands of years since the cave-dwellers
left their records on walls and bones. In the
mystic shadow of the Golden Bough, and
swayed by the emotions of our savage ancestors,
we stand aghast at the revelation
of the depth and ferocity of primal passions
which reveal the unchangeableness of human
nature.</p>

<p class="indent">When the wild beast of Plato&#39;s dream
becomes a waking reality, and a herd-emotion
of hate sweeps a nation off its feet,
the desolation that follows is wider than
that in France and Belgium, wider even
than the desolation of grief, and something
worse&mdash;the hardened heart, the lie in the
soul&mdash;so graphically described in Book II
of the &quot;Republic&quot;&mdash;that forces us to do
accursed things, and even to defend them!
I refer to it because, as professors, we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
been accused of sinning against the light.
Of course we have. Over us, too, the wave
swept, but I protest against the selection of
us for special blame. The other day, in an
address on &quot;The Comradeship of Letters&quot;
at Turin, President Wilson is reported to
have said: &quot;It is one of the great griefs of
this war that the universities of the Central
Empires used the thoughts of science
to destroy mankind; it is the duty of the
universities of these states to redeem science
from this disgrace and to show that the
pulse of humanity beats in the classroom,
and that there are sought out not the secrets
of death but the secrets of life.&quot; A pious
and worthy wish! But once in war a nation
mobilizes every energy, and to say that
science has been prostituted in discovering
means of butchery is to misunderstand the
situation. Slaughter, wholesale and unrestricted,
is what is sought, and to accomplish
this the discoveries of the sainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
Faraday and of the gentle Dalton are utilized
to the full, and to their several nations
scientific men render this service freely, if
not gladly. That the mental attitude engendered
by science is apt to lead to a gross
materialism is a vulgar error. Scientific
men, in mufti or in uniform, are not more
brutal than their fellows, and the utilization
of their discoveries in warfare should not be
a greater reproach to them than is our joyous
acceptance of their success.</p>

<p class="indent">What a change of heart after the appalling
experience of the first gassing in 1915!
Nothing more piteously horrible than the
sufferings of the victims has ever been seen
in warfare.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Surely we could not sink to
such barbarity! Is thy servant a dog? But
martial expediency soon compelled the
Allies to enlist the resources of chemistry;
the instruction of our enemies was soon
bettered, and before the Armistice there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
developments in technique and destructive
force that would have delighted Nisroch,
who first invented aerial &quot;machinations
to plague the sons of men.&quot; A group of
medical men representing the chief universities
and medical bodies of the United
Kingdom was innocent enough to suggest
that such an unclean weapon&mdash;the use of
lethal gases, &quot;condemning its victims to
death by long-drawn-out torture,&quot; and
with infinite possibilities for its further development&mdash;should
be forever abolished.
&quot;Steeped in folly by theories and prepossessions,&quot;
failure to read the &quot;lessons of
war which should have sufficed to convince
a beetle&quot;&mdash;such were among the
newspaper comments; and in other ways
we were given to understand that our interference
in such matters was most untimely.
All the same, it is gratifying to see that the
suggestion has been adopted at the Peace
Congress.</p>

<p class="indent">Against reprisals there was at first a
strong feeling. Early in 1916 I wrote to the
&quot;Times&quot;: &quot;The cry for reprisals illustrates
the exquisitely hellish state of mind
into which war plunges even sensible men.
Not a pacifist, but a &#39;last-ditcher,&#39; yet I refuse
to believe that as a nation, how bitter
soever the provocation, we shall stain our
hands in the blood of the innocent. In this
matter let us be free from bloodguiltiness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
and let not the undying reproach of humanity
rest on us as on the Germans.&quot; Two
years changed me into an ordinary barbarian.
A detailed tally of civilians killed by
our airmen has not, I believe, been published,
but the total figures quoted are not
far behind the German.</p>

<p class="indent">Could a poll have been taken a week before
the Armistice as to the moral justification
of the bombing of Berlin&mdash;for which
we were ready&mdash;how we should have
howled at the proposer of any doubt! And
many Jonahs were displeased that a city
greater than Nineveh, with more than the
threescore and ten thousand who knew not
the right hand from the left, had been
spared. We may deplore the necessity and
lament, as did a certain great personage:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;... Yet public reason just&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Honour and empire with revenge enlarged</span><br />
<span class="i4">... compels me now</span><br />
<span class="i0">To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
All the same, we considered ourselves
&quot;Christians of the best edition, all picked
and culled,&quot; and the churches remained
open, prayers rose to Jehovah, many of
whose priests&mdash;even his bishops!&mdash;were
in khaki, and quit themselves like men&mdash;yes,
and scores died the death of heroes!
Into such hells of inconsistency does war
plunge the best of us!</p>

<p class="indent">Learning&mdash;new or old&mdash;seems a vain
thing to save a nation, but possibly, as a set-off,
science, as represented by cellulose and
sulphuric acid, may yet prove the best bulwark
of civilization! In his &quot;History of the
Origin of Medicine,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Lettsom maintains
that the invention of firearms has done more
to prevent the destruction of the human
species than any other discovery; he says:
&quot;Invention and discernment of mind have
made it possible to reverse the ancient maxim
that strength has always prevailed over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
wisdom.&quot; Science alone may prevent a repetition
of the story of Egypt, of Babylonia,
of Greece, and of Rome. The suggestion
seems brazen effrontery when we have not
even given the world the equivalent of the
<i>Pax Romana</i>! Ah! what a picture of self-satisfied
happiness in Plutarch! One envies
that placid life in the midst of the only great
peace the world has known, spanning a period
of more than two hundred years. And
he could say, &quot;No tumults, no civil sedition,
no tyrannies, no pestilences nor calamities
depopulating Greece, no epidemic disease
needing powerful and choice drugs and
medicines&quot;; though as a Delphic priest
there is a pathetic lament that the Pythian
priestess has now only commonplace questions
to deal with.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Surely those cultivated
men of his circle must have felt that their
house could never be removed. Has Science
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
reached such control over Nature that she
will enable our civilization to escape the law
of the Ephesian, written on all known records&mdash;<i>panta
rei</i>? Perhaps so, now that
material civilization is world-wide; cataclysmic
forces, powerful enough in centres
of origin, may weaken as they pass out in
circles. Let this be our hope in the present
crisis. At any rate, in the free democracies
in which Demos with safety says &quot;<i>L&#39;État
c&#39;est moi</i>,&quot; it has yet to be determined
whether Science, as the embodiment of a
mechanical force, can rule without invoking
ruin. Two things are clear: there must
be a very different civilization or there will be
no civilization at all; and the other is that
neither the old religion combined with the
old learning, nor both with the new science,
suffice to save a nation bent on self-destruction.
The suicide of Germany, the outstanding
fact of the war, followed an outburst
of national megalomania. For she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
had religion&mdash;it may shock some of you to
hear! I mean the people, not the writers or
the thinkers, but the people for whom Luther
lived and Huss died. Of the two devotional
ceremonies which stand supreme in
my memory, one was a service in the Dom,
Berlin, in which &quot;not the great nor well bespoke,
but the mere uncounted folk&quot; sang
Luther&#39;s great hymn &quot;<i>Ein&#39; feste Burg ist
unser Gott.</i>&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> With the Humanities Germany
never broke, and the proportion of
students in her schools and universities who
studied Greek and Latin has been higher
than in any other country. You know better
than I the innumerable classical studies
of her scholars. In classical learning
relating to science and medicine she simply
had the field; for one scholar in other countries
she had a dozen, and the monopoly of
journals relating to the history of these subjects.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
And she had science, and led the
world in the application of the products of
the laboratory to the uses of every-day life&mdash;in
commerce, in the arts, and in war.
Withal, like Jeshurun, she waxed fat; and
did ever such pride go before such destruction?
What a tragedy that the successors
of Virchow and Traube and Helmholtz and
Billroth should have made her a byword
among the nations! &quot;Lilies that fester
smell far worse than weeds!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So much preliminary to the business before
us, to meet changed conditions as
practical men, with the reinforcement born
of hope or with the strong resolution of despair.</p>

<p class="indent">For what does this Association stand?
What are these classical interests that you
represent? Take a familiar simile. By a
very simple trick, you remember, did Empedocles
give Menippus in the moon-halt&mdash;the
first stage of his memorable trip&mdash;such
long and clear vision that he saw the
tribes of men like a nest of ants, a seething
mass going to and fro at their different
tasks. Of the function of the classical members
in this myrmecic community there can
be no question. Neither warriors, nor slaves,
nor neuters, you live in a well-protected
social environment, heretofore free from enemies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
and have been well taken care of. I
hate to speak of you as larvæ, but as such
you perform a duty of the greatest import
in this trophidium stage of your existence.
Let me explain. From earliest days much
attention has been paid by naturalists to the
incredible affection &quot;&mdash;incredible &#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#942;,&quot;
Swammerdam calls it&mdash;which ants display
in feeding, licking, and attending the larvæ.
Disturb a nest, and the chief care is to
take them to a place of safety. This attention
is what our symphilic community&mdash;to
use a biological term&mdash;bestows on you.
So intensely altruistic, apparently, is this
behaviour, that for the very word &quot;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#942;,&quot;
which expresses the tenderest of all feelings,
there is a difficulty in finding an equivalent;
indeed, Gilbert White used it almost
as an English word. The truth is really very
different.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been shown that the nursing function&mdash;or
instinct&mdash;is really trophallactic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
In the case of the ant the nurse places the
larva on its back, and the broad ventral surface
serves as a trough for the food, often
predigested. The skill and devotion with
which this is done are among the wonders
in the life of the insect to which moralists
have never tired of urging a visit. But listen
to the sequel! The larva is provided
with a pair of rich honey-bags in the shape
of salivary glands, big exudatoria from
which is discharged an ambrosia greedily
lapped up by the nurse, who with this considers
herself well paid for her care. In the
same manner, when the assiduous V.A.D.
wasp distributes food to the larvæ, the heads
of which eagerly protrude from their cells,
she must be paid by a draught of nectar
from their exudatoria, while if it is not
forthcoming the wasp seizes the head of the
larva in her mandibles and jams it back into
its cell and compels it to pay up. The lazy
males will play the same game and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
steal the much-sought liquid without any
compensatory gift of nourishment.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>

<p class="indent">What does the community at large, so
careful of your comforts, expect from you?
Surely the honey-dew and the milk of paradise
secreted from your classical exudatoria,
which we lap up greedily in recensions,
monographs, commentaries, histories,
translations, and brochures. Among
academic larvæ you have for centuries absorbed
the almost undivided interest of the
nest, and not without reason, for the very
life of the workers depends on the hormones
you secrete. Though small in number,
your group has an enormous kinetic
value, like our endocrine organs. For man&#39;s
body, too, is a humming hive of working
cells, each with its specific function, all under
central control of the brain and heart,
and all dependent on materials called hormones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
(secreted by small, even insignificant-looking
structures) which lubricate the
wheels of life. For example, remove the
thyroid gland just below the Adam&#39;s apple,
and you deprive man of the lubricants
which enable his thought-engines to work&mdash;it
is as if you cut off the oil-supply of a
motor&mdash;and gradually the stored acquisitions
of his mind cease to be available, and
within a year he sinks into dementia. The
normal processes of the skin cease, the hair
falls, the features bloat, and the paragon of
animals is transformed into a shapeless
caricature of humanity. These essential
lubricators, of which a number are now
known, are called hormones&mdash;you will recognize
from its derivation how appropriate
is the term.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, the men of your guild secrete materials
which do for society at large what
the thyroid gland does for the individual.
The Humanities are the hormones. Our

friend Mr. P. S. Allen read before this Association
a most suggestive paper on the
historical evolution of the word &quot;Humanism.&quot;
I like to think of the pleasant-flavoured
word as embracing all the knowledge
of the ancient classical world&mdash;what man
knew of nature as well as what he knew
of himself. Let us see what this university
means by the <i>Literæ Humaniores</i>. The
&quot;Greats&quot; papers for the past decade make
interesting study. With singular uniformity
there is diversity enough to bear high
tribute to the ingenuity of the examiners.
But, comparing the subjects in 1918 with
those in the first printed papers of the school
in 1831, one is surprised to find them the
same&mdash;practically no change in the eighty-seven
years! Compare them, again, with the
subjects given in John Napleton&#39;s &quot;Considerations&quot;
in 1773&mdash;no change! and with
the help of Rashdall we may trace the story
of the studies in arts, only to find that as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
far back as 1267, with different names
sometimes, they have been through all the
centuries essentially the same&mdash;Greek and
Latin authors, logic, rhetoric, grammar,
and the philosophies, natural, moral, and
metaphysical&mdash;practically the seven liberal
arts for which, as you may see by the
names over the doors, Bodley&#39;s building
provided accommodation. Why this invariableness
in an ever-turning world? One
of the marvels, so commonplace that it has
ceased to be marvellous, is the deep rooting
of our civilization in the soil of Greece
and Rome&mdash;much of our dogmatic religion,
practically all the philosophies, the
models of our literature, the ideals of our
democratic freedom, the fine and the technical
arts, the fundamentals of science, and
the basis of our law. The Humanities bring
the student into contact with the master
minds who gave us these things&mdash;with the
dead who never die, with those immortal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
lives &quot;not of now nor of yesterday, but
which always were.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As true to-day as in the fifth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the name of Hellas stands no longer
for the name of a race, but as the name
of knowledge; or, as more tersely put by
Maine, &quot;Except the blind forces of Nature,
nothing moves [intellectually, he means]
in this world that is not Greek in origin.&quot;
Man&#39;s anabasis from the old priest-ridden
civilizations of the East began when &quot;the
light of reason lighted up all things,&quot; with
which saying Anaxagoras expressed our
modern outlook on life.</p>

<p class="indent">The Humanities have been a subject of
criticism in two directions. Their overwhelming
prominence, it is claimed, prevents
the development of learning in other
and more useful directions; and the method
of teaching is said to be antiquated and out
of touch with the present needs. They control
the academic life of Oxford. An analysis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
of the Register for 1919 shows that of the
257 men comprising the Heads and Fellows
of the twenty-three colleges (including
St. Edmund&#39;s Hall), only fifty-one are
scientific, including the mathematicians.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not very polite, perhaps, to suggest
that as transmitters and interpreters they
should not bulk quite so large in a modern
university. &#39;Twas all very well</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;... in days when wits were fresh and clear</span><br />
<span class="i0">And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames&mdash;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">in those happy days when it was felt that
all knowledge had been garnered by those
divine men of old time, that there was nothing
left but to enjoy the good things harvested
by such universal providers as Isidore,
Rabanus Maurus, and Vincent of
Beauvais, and those stronger dishes served
by such artists as Albertus Magnus and
St. Thomas Aquinas&mdash;delicious blends of
such skill that only the palate of an Apicius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
could separate Greek, Patristic, and
Arabian savours.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not the dominance, but the unequal
dominance that is a cause of just complaint.
As to methods of teaching&mdash;by their fruits
ye shall know them. The product of
&quot;Greats&quot; needs no description in this
place. Many deny the art to find the mind&#39;s
construction in the face, but surely not the
possibility of diagnosing at a glance a &quot;first
in Greats&quot;! Only in him is seen that altogether
superior expression, that self-consciousness
of having reached life&#39;s goal, of
having, in that pickled sentence of Dean
Gaisford&#39;s Christmas sermon, done something
&quot;that not only elevates above the
common herd, but leads not unfrequently
to positions of considerable emolument.&quot;
&quot;Many are the wand-bearers, few are the
mystics,&quot; and a system should not be judged
by the exceptions. As a discipline of the
mind for the few, the system should not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
touched, and we should be ready to sacrifice
a holocaust of undergraduates every
year to produce in each generation a scholar
of the type of, say, Ingram Bywater. &#39;Tis
Nature&#39;s method&mdash;does it not cost some
thousands of eggs and fry to produce one
salmon?</p>

<p class="indent">But the average man, not of scholar
timber, may bring one railing accusation
against his school and college. Apart from
mental discipline, the value of the ancient
languages is to give a key to their literatures.
Yet we make boys and young men
spend ten or more years on the study of
Greek and Latin, at the end of which time
the beauties of the languages are still hidden
because of the pernicious method in which
they are taught. It passes my understanding
how the more excellent way of Montaigne,
of Milton, and of Locke should have
been neglected until recently. Make the language
an instrument to play with and to play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
with thoroughly, and recognize that except
for the few in &quot;Mods.&quot; and  &quot;Greats&quot; it
is superfluous to know how the instrument
is constructed, or to dissect the neuro-muscular
mechanism by which it is played. It
is satisfactory to read that the Greek Curriculum
Committee thinks &quot;it is possible
in a comparatively short time to acquire a
really valuable knowledge of Greek, and to
learn to read with accuracy and fair fluency
some of the most important works in Greek
literature.&quot; I am sure of it, if the teacher
will go to school to Montaigne and feed fat
against that old scoundrel Protagoras a
well-earned grudge for inventing grammar&mdash;<i>pace</i>
Mr. Livingstone, every chapter in
whose two books appeal to me, except
those on grammar, against which I have
a medullary prejudice. I speak, of course,
as a fool among the wise, and I am not
pleading for the &quot;Greats&quot; men, but for the
average man, whom to infect with the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
of the Humanities is the greatest single gift
in education. To you of the elect this is pure
<i>camouflage</i>&mdash;the amateur talking to the experts;
but there is another side upon which
I feel something may be said by one whose
best friends have been the old Humanists,
and whose breviary is Plutarch, or rather
Plutarch gallicized by Montaigne. Paraphrasing
Mark Twain&#39;s comment upon
Christian Science, the so-called Humanists
have not enough Science, and Science sadly
lacks the Humanities. This unhappy divorce,
which should never have taken place,
has been officially recognized in the two
reports edited by Sir Frederic Kenyon,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
which have stirred the pool, and cannot but
be helpful. To have got constructive, anabolic
action from representatives of interests
so diverse is most encouraging. While
all agree that neither in the public schools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
nor in the older universities are the conditions
at present in keeping with the urgent
scientific needs of the nation, the specific is
not to be sought in endowments alone, but
in the leaven which may work a much-needed
change in both branches of knowledge.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="indent">The School of <i>Literæ Humaniores</i> excites
wonder in the extent and variety
of the knowledge demanded, and there is
everywhere evidence of the value placed
upon the ancient models; but this wonder
pales before the gasping astonishment at
what is not there. Now and again a hint,
a reference, a recognition, but the moving
forces which have made the modern world
are simply ignored. Yet they are all Hellenic,
all part and parcel of the Humanities
in the true sense, and all of prime importance
in modern education. Twin berries on
one stem, grievous damage has been done
to both in regarding the Humanities and
Science in any other light than complemental.
Perhaps the anomalous position of science
in our philosophical school is due to
the necessary filtration, indeed the preservation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
of our classical knowledge, through
ecclesiastical channels. Of this the persistence
of the Augustinian questions until late
in the eighteenth century is an interesting
indication. The moulder of Western Christianity
had not much use for science, and
the Greek spirit was stifled in the atmosphere
of the Middle Ages. &quot;Content to be
deceived, to live in a twilight of fiction, under
clouds of false witnesses, inventing according
to convenience, and glad to welcome
the forger and the cheat&quot;&mdash;such, as
Lord Acton somewhere says, were the Middle
Ages. Strange, is it not? that one man
alone, Roger Bacon, mastered his environment
and had a modern outlook.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_9_9">
<span class="label">[9]</span></a>
How modern Bacon&#39;s outlook was may be judged from the
following sentence: &quot;Experimental science has three great prerogatives
over all other sciences&mdash;it verifies conclusions by direct experiment,
it discovers truths which they could never reach, and it
investigates the secrets of nature and opens to us a knowledge of the
past and of the future.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The practical point for us here is that in
the only school dealing with the philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
of human thought, the sources of the new
science that has made a new world are practically
ignored. One gets even an impression
of neglect in the schools, or at any rate
of scant treatment, of the Ionian philosophers,
the very fathers of your fathers. Few
&quot;Greats&quot; men, I fear, could tell why Hippocrates
is a living force to-day, or why a
modern scientific physician would feel more
at home with Erasistratus and Herophilus
at Alexandria, or with Galen at Pergamos,
than at any period in our story up to, say,
Harvey. Except as a delineator of character,
what does the Oxford scholar know of
Theophrastus, the founder of modern botany,
and a living force to-day in one of the
two departments of biology, and made accessible
to English readers&mdash;perhaps indeed
to Greek readers!&mdash;by Sir Arthur
Hort?<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Beggarly recognition or base indifference
is meted out to the men whose minds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
have fertilized science in every department.
The pulse of every student should beat
faster as he reads the story of Archimedes,
of Hero, of Aristarchus, names not even
mentioned in the &quot;Greats&quot; papers in the
past decade. Yet the methods of these men
exorcised vagaries and superstitions from
the human mind and pointed to a clear
knowledge of the laws of nature. It is surprising
that some wag among the examiners
has never relieved the grave monotony
of the papers by such peripatetic questions
as &quot;How long a gnat lives,&quot; &quot;To how
many fathoms&#39; depth the sunlight penetrates
the sea,&quot; and &quot;What an oyster&#39;s
soul is like&quot;&mdash;questions which indicate
whence the modern Lucian got his inspiration
to chaff so successfully Boyle and the
professors of Gresham College.</p>

<p class="indent">May I dwell upon two instances of shocking
neglect? It really is amusing in Oxford
to assert neglect of &quot;the measurer of all Art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
and Science, whose is all that is best in the
passing sublunary world,&quot; as Richard de
Bury calls &quot;the Prince of the Schooles.&quot; In
Gulliver&#39;s voyage to Laputa he paid a visit
to the little island of Glubbdubdrib, whose
Governor, you remember, had an Endorian
command over the spirits, such as Sir Oliver
Lodge or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle might
envy. When Aristotle and his commentators
were summoned, to Gulliver&#39;s surprise
they were strangers, for the reason that having
so horribly misrepresented Aristotle&#39;s
meaning to posterity, a consciousness of
guilt and shame kept them far away from
him in the lower world. Such shame, I fear,
will make the shades of many classical dons
of this university seek shelter with the commentators
when they realize their neglect of
one of the most fruitful of all the activities
of the Master. In biology Aristotle speaks
for the first time the language of modern science,
and indeed he seems to have been first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
and foremost a biologist, and his natural history
studies influenced profoundly his sociology,
his psychology, and his philosophy
in general. The beginner may be sent now
to Professor D&#39;Arcy Wentworth Thompson&#39;s
Herbert Spencer Lecture, 1913, and he
must be indeed a dull and muddy-mettled
rascal whose imagination is not fired by
the enthusiastic&mdash;yet true&mdash;picture of the
founder of modern biology, whose language
is our language, whose methods and problems
are our own, the man who knew a thousand
varied forms of life,&mdash;of plant, of
bird, and animal,&mdash;their outward structure,
their metamorphosis, their early development;
who studied the problems of
heredity, of sex, of nutrition, of growth, of
adaptation, and of the struggle for existence.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
And the senior student, if capable
of appreciating a biological discovery, I advise
to study the account by Johannes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
Müller<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (himself a pioneer in anatomy) of
his rediscovery of Aristotle&#39;s remarkable
discovery of a special mode of reproduction
in one of the species of sharks. For
two thousand years the founder of the
science of embryology had neither rival
nor worthy follower. There is no reference,
I believe, to the biological works in the
<i>Literæ Humaniores</i> papers for the past ten
years, yet they form the very foundations
of discoveries that have turned our philosophies
topsy-turvy.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing reveals the unfortunate break
in Humanities more clearly than the treatment
of the greatest nature-poet in literature,
a man who had &quot;gazed on Nature&#39;s
naked loveliness&quot; unabashed, the man
who united, as no one else has ever done,
the &quot;functions and temper and achievement
of science and poetry&quot; (Herford).
The golden work of Lucretius is indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
recognized, and in Honour Moderations,
Books I to III and V are set as one of seven
alternatives in section D; and scattered
through the &quot;Greats&quot; papers are set translations
and snippets here and there; but
anything like adequate consideration from
the scientific side is to be sought in vain.
Unmatched among the ancients or moderns
is the vision by Lucretius of continuity in
the workings of Nature&mdash;not less of <i>le
silence éternel de ces espaces infinis</i> which so
affrighted Pascal, than of &quot;the long, limitless
age of days, the age of all time that has
gone by&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">And it is in a Latin poet that we find up-to-date
views of the origin of the world and
of the origin of man. The description of the
wild discordant storm of atoms (Book V)
which led to the birth of the world might
be transferred verbatim to the accounts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Poincaré or of Arrhenius of the growth
of new celestial bodies in the Milky Way.
What an insight into primitive man and

have been a contemporary and friend, and
doubtless was a tutor, of Tylor. Book II,

<p class="indent">can only be read appreciatively by pupils
of Roentgen or of J. J. Thomson. The
ring theory of magnetism advanced in Book

whose magnetons rotating as rings at
high speed have the form and effect with
which this disciple of Democritus clothes
his magnetic physics.</p>

<p class="indent">And may I here enter a protest? Of love-philtres
that produce insanity we may read
the truth in a chapter of that most pleasant
manual of erotology, the &quot;Anatomy of

Melancholy.&quot; Of insanity of any type that
leaves a mind capable in lucid intervals of
writing such verses as <i>&quot;De Rerum Natura&quot;</i>
we know nothing. The sole value of the
myth is its causal association with the poem
of Tennyson. Only exsuccous dons who
have never known the wiles and ways of the
younger Aphrodite would take the intensity
of the feeling in Book IV as witness to anything
but an accident which may happen to
the wisest of the wise, when enthralled by
Vivien or some dark lady of the Sonnets!</p>

<p class="indent">In the School of <i>Literæ Humaniores</i> the
studies are based on classical literature and
on history, &quot;but a large number of students
approach philosophical study from other
sides. Students of such subjects as mathematics,
natural science, history, psychology,
anthropology, or political economy
become naturally interested in philosophy,
and their needs are at present very imperfectly
provided for in this university.&quot; This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
I quote from a Report to the Board of the
Faculty of Arts made just before the war on
a proposed new Honour School, the subject
of which should be the principles of philosophy
considered in their relation to the
sciences. That joint action of this kind
should have been taken by the Boards of
Arts and of Science indicates a widespread
conviction that no man is cultivated up to
the standard of his generation who has not
an appreciation of how the greatest achievements
of the human mind have been reached;
and the practical question is how to introduce
such studies into the course of liberal education,
how to give the science school the leaven
of an old philosophy, how to leaven the
old philosophical school with the thoughts
of science.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>

It is important to recognize that there is
nothing mysterious in the method of science,
or apart from the ordinary routine of life.
Science has been defined as the habit or
faculty of observation. By such the child
grows in knowledge, and in its daily exercise
an adult lives and moves. Only a quantitative
difference makes observation scientific&mdash;accuracy;
in that way alone do we
discover things as they really are. This is
the essence of Plato&#39;s definition of science
as &quot;the discovery of things as they really
are,&quot; whether in the heavens above, in the
earth beneath, or in the observer himself.
As a mental operation, the scientific method
is equally applicable to deciphering a bit
of Beneventan script, to the analysis of the
evidence of the Commission on Coal-Mines,
a study of the mechanism of the nose-dive,
or of the colour-scheme in tiger-beetles.
To observation and reasoned thought, the
Greek added experiment, but never fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
used it in biology, an instrument which has
made science productive, and to which the
modern world owes its civilization. Our
every-day existence depends on the practical
application of discoveries in pure science
by men who had no other motives than
a search for knowledge of Nature&#39;s laws,
a disinterestedness which Burnet claims to
be the distinctive gift of Hellas to humanity.
With the discovery of induced currents
Faraday had no thought of the dynamo.
Crookes&#39;s tubes were a plaything until
Roentgen turned them into practical use
with the X-rays. Perkin had no thought
of transforming chemical industry when
he discovered aniline dyes. Priestley would
have cursed the observation that an electrical
charge produced nitrous acid had he
foreseen that it would enable Germany to
prolong the war, but he would have blessed
the thought that it may make us independent
of all outside sources for fertilizers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
The extraordinary development of modern
science may be her undoing. Specialism,
now a necessity, has fragmented the
specialities themselves in a way that makes
the outlook hazardous. The workers lose all
sense of proportion in a maze of minutiæ.
Everywhere men are in small coteries intensely
absorbed in subjects of deep interest,
but of very limited scope. Chemistry,
a century ago an appanage of the Chair of
Medicine or even of Divinity, has now a
dozen departments, each with its laboratory
and literature, sometimes its own society.
Applying themselves early to research,
young men get into backwaters far from
the main stream. They quickly lose the
sense of proportion, become hypercritical,
and the smaller the field, the greater the
tendency to megalocephaly. The study for
fourteen years of the variations in the colour-scheme
of the thirteen hundred species of
tiger-beetles scattered over the earth may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
sterilize a man into a sticker of pins and a
paster of labels; on the other hand, he may
be a modern biologist whose interest is in
the experimental modification of types, and
in the mysterious insulation of hereditary
characters from the environment. Only in
one direction does the modern specialist
acknowledge his debt to the dead languages.
Men of science pay homage, as do
no others, to the god of words whose magic
power is nowhere so manifest as in the plastic
language of Greece. The only visit many
students pay to Parnassus is to get an intelligible
label for a fact or form newly discovered.
Turn the pages of such a dictionary
of chemical terms as Morley and Muir, and
you meet in close-set columns countless
names unknown a decade ago, and unintelligible
to the specialist in another department
unless familiar with Greek, and as
meaningless as the Arabic jargon in such
mediæval collections as the &quot;Synonyma&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
of Simon Januensis or the &quot;Pandects&quot; of
Matheas Sylvaticus. As &quot;Punch&quot; put it

<p class="indent">Within the narrow compass of the primitive
cell from which all living beings originate,
onomatomania runs riot. The process
of mitosis has developed a special literature
and language. Dealing not alone with the
problems of heredity and of sex, but with the
very dynamics of life, the mitotic complex
is much more than a simple physiological
process, and in the action and interaction
of physical forces the cytologist hopes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
find the key to the secret of life itself. And
what a Grecian he has become! Listen to
this account, which Aristotle would understand
much better than most of us.</p>

<p class="indent">The karyogranulomes, not the idiogranulomes
or microsomenstratum in the protoplasm
of the spermatogonia, unite into
the idiosphærosome, acrosoma of Lenhossék,
a protean phase, as the idiosphærosome
differentiates into an idiocryptosome
and an idiocalyptosome, both surrounded
by the idiosphærotheca, the archoplasmic
vesicle; but the idioectosome disappears
in the metamorphosis of the spermatid into
a sphere, the idiophtharosome. The separation
of the calyptosome from the cryptosome
antedates the transformation of the
idiosphærotheca into the spermiocalyptrotheca.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>

<p class="indent">Or take a more practical if less Cratylean

example. In our precious cabbage-patches
the holometabolous insecta are the hosts
of parasitic polyembryonic hymenoptera,
upon the prevalence of which rests the psychic
and somatic stamina of our fellow
countrymen; for the larvæ of <i>Pieris brassicæ</i>,
vulgarly cabbage butterfly, are parasitiased
by the <i>Apantales glomeratus</i>, which in turn
has a hyperparasite, the <i>Mesochorus pallidus</i>.
It is tragic to think that the fate of a
plant, the dietetic and pharmaceutical virtues
of which have been so extolled by Cato,
and upon which two of my Plinean colleagues
of uncertain date, Chrysippus and
Dieuches, wrote monographs&mdash;it fills one
with terror to think that a crop so dear to
Hodge (<i>et veris cymata!</i> the Brussels sprouts
of Columella) should depend on the deposition
in the ovum of the Pieris of another
polyembryonic egg. The cytoplasm or
oöplasm of this forms a trophoamnion and
develops into a polygerminal mass, a spherical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
morula, from which in turn develop a
hundred or more larvæ, which immediately
proceed to eat up everything in and of the
body of their host. Only in this way does
Nature preserve the Selenas, the Leas, and
the Crambes, so dear to Cato and so necessary
for the sustenance of our hard-working,
brawny-armed Brasserii.</p>

<p class="indent">From over-specialization scientific men
are in a more parlous state than are the
Humanists from neglect of classical tradition.
The salvation of science lies in a recognition
of a new philosophy&mdash;the <i>scientia
scientiarum</i> of which Plato speaks. &quot;Now
when all these studies reach the point of intercommunion
and connection with one another
and come to be considered in their
mutual affinities, then, I think, and not till
then, will the pursuit of them have a value.&quot;
Upon this synthetic process I hesitate to
dwell; since, like Dr. Johnson&#39;s friend,
Oliver Edwards, I have never succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
mastering philosophy&mdash;cheerfulness was
always breaking in.</p>

<p class="indent">In the proposed Honour School the principles
of philosophy are to be dealt with in
relation to the sciences, and by the introduction
of literary and historical studies,
which George Sarton advocates so warmly
as the new Humanism,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the student will
gain a knowledge of the evolution of modern
scientific thought. But to limit the history
to the modern period&mdash;Kepler to the
present time is suggested&mdash;would be a
grave error. The scientific student should
go to the sources and in some way be taught
the connection of Democritus with Dalton,
of Archimedes with Kelvin, of Aristarchus
with Newton, of Galen with John Hunter,
and of Plato and Aristotle with them all.
And the glories of Greek science should be
opened in a sympathetic way to &quot;Greats&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
men. Under new regulations at the public
schools, a boy of sixteen or seventeen should
have enough science to appreciate the position
of Theophrastus in botany, and perhaps
himself construct Hero&#39;s fountain.
Science will take a totally different position
in this country when the knowledge of its
advances is the possession of all educated
men. The time, too, is ripe for the Bodleian
to become a <i>studium generale</i>, with ten or
more departments, each in charge of a
special sub-librarian. When the beautiful
rooms, over the portals of which are the
mocking blue and gold inscriptions, are
once more alive with students, the task of
teaching subjects on historical lines will be
greatly lightened. What has been done
with the Music-Room, and with the Science-Room
through the liberality of Dr.
and Mrs. Singer, should be done for classics,
history, literature, theology, etc., each
section in charge of a sub-librarian who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
will be <i>Doctor perplexorum</i> alike to professor,
don, and undergraduate.</p>

<p class="indent">I wish time had permitted me to sketch
even briefly the story of the evolution of science
in this old seat of learning. A fortunate
opportunity enables you to see two phases
in its evolution. Through the kind permission
of several of the colleges, particularly
Christ Church, Merton, St. John&#39;s, and
Oriel, and with the coöperation of the
Curators of the Bodleian and Dr. Cowley,
Mr. R. T. Gunther, of Magdalen College,
has arranged a loan exhibition of the early
scientific instruments and manuscripts. A
series of quadrants and astrolabes show
how Arabian instruments, themselves retaining
much of the older Greek models,
have translated Alexandrian science into
the Western world. Some were constructed
for the latitude of Oxford, and one was associated
with our astronomer-poet Chaucer.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time the instruments and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
works of the early members of the Merton
School of astronomer-physicians have been
brought together. They belong to a group
of men of the fourteenth century&mdash;Reed,
Aschenden, Simon Bredon, Merle, Richard
of Wallingford, and others&mdash;whose labours
made Oxford the leading scientific
university of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Little remains of the scientific apparatus
of the early period of the Royal Society, but
through the kindness of the Dean and Governing
Body of Christ Church, the entire
contents of the cabinet of philosophical
apparatus of the Earl of Orrery, who flourished
some thirty years after the foundation
of the Society, is on exhibit, and the
actual astronomical model, the &quot;Orrery,&quot;
made for him and called after his name.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>

Among other notable exhibits there are:</p>

<p class="indent">1. A series of astronomical volvelles in manuscripts and printed
books.</p>

<p class="indent">2. The printed evidence that Leonard Digges of University College
was the inventor of the telescope many years before Galileo.</p>

<p class="indent">3. The mathematical work of Robert Recorde of All Souls&#39;
College, in which he suggested the St. Andrew&#39;s Cross as the sign
of multiplication, and uses symbols +, -, =.</p>

<p class="indent">4. The earliest known slide-rule in a circular form, recently discovered
in St. John&#39;s College.</p>

<p class="indent">5. The early vellum and wooden telescopes of the Orrery Collection.</p>

<p class="indent">6. An original Marshall microscope.</p>

<p class="indent">7. Early surveying instruments, including the great quadrate of
Schissler.</p>

The story of the free cities of Greece
shows how a love of the higher and brighter
things in life may thrive in a democracy.
Whether such love may develop in a civilization
based on a philosophy of force is the
present problem of the Western world. To-day
there are doubts, even thoughts of despair,
but neither man nor nation is to be
judged by the behaviour in a paroxysm of
delirium. Lavoisier perished in the Revolution,
and the Archbishop of Paris was
butchered at the altar by the Commune, yet
France was not wrecked; and Russia may
survive the starvation of such scholars as
Danielevski and Smirnov, and the massacre
of Botkin. To have intelligent freemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
of the Greek type with a stake in the State
(not mere chattels from whose daily life the
shadow of the workhouse never lifts), to
have the men and women who could love
the light put in surroundings in which the
light may reach them, to encourage in all
a sense of brotherhood reaching the standard
of the Good Samaritan&mdash;surely the
realization in a democracy of such reasonable
ambitions should be compatible with
the control by science of the forces of nature
for the common good, and a love of all that
is best in religion, in art, and in literature.</p>

<p class="indent">Amid the smoke and squalor of a modern
industrial city, after the bread-and-butter
struggle of the day, &quot;the Discobolus has
no gospel.&quot; Our puritanized culture has
been known to call the Antinous vulgar.
Copies of these two statues, you may remember,
Samuel Butler found stored away
in the lumber-room of the Natural History
Museum, Montreal, with skins, plants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
snakes, and insects, and in their midst,
stuffing an owl, sat &quot;the brother-in-law
of the haberdasher of Mr. Spurgeon.&quot;
Against the old man who thus blasphemed
beauty, Butler broke into those memorable
verses with the refrain &quot;O God! O Montreal!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Let us not be discouraged. The direction
of our vision is everything, and after weltering
four years in chaos poor stricken
humanity still nurses the unconquerable
hope of an ideal state &quot;whose citizens are
happy ... absolutely wise, all of them
brave, just, and self-controlled ... all at
peace and unity and in the enjoyment of
legality, equality, liberty, and all other
good things.&quot; Lucian&#39;s winning picture
of this &quot;Universal Happiness&quot; might
have been sketched by a Round Table pen
or some youthful secretary to the League
of Nations. That such hope persists is a
witness to the power of ideals to captivate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
the mind and the reality may be nearer
than any of us dare dream. If survived, a
terrible infection, such as confluent smallpox,
seems to benefit the general health.
Perhaps such an attack through which we
have passed may benefit the body cosmic.
After discussing the various forms of government,
Plato concludes that &quot;States are
as the men are, they grow out of human
characters,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and then, as the dream-republic
approached completion, he realized
that after all the true State is within, of
which each one of us is the founder, and
patterned on an ideal the existence of which
matters not a whit. Is not the need of this
individual reconstruction the Greek message
to modern democracy? And with it
is blended the note of individual service to
the community on which Professor Gilbert
Murray has so wisely dwelt.</p>

<p class="indent">With the hot blasts of hate still on our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
cheeks, it may seem a mockery to speak of
this as the saving asset in our future; but
is it not the very marrow of the teaching in
which we have been brought up? At last
the gospel of the right to live, and the right
to live healthy, happy lives, has sunk deep
into the hearts of the people; and before
the war, so great was the work of science
in preventing untimely death that the day
of Isaiah seemed at hand, when a man&#39;s
life should be &quot;more precious than fine
gold, even a man than the golden wedge of
Ophir.&quot; There is a sentence in the writings
of the Father of Medicine upon which
all commentators have lingered, &quot;&#7970;&#957; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8135; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#943;&#951;, &#960;&#940;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#967;&#957;&#943;&#951;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;the
love of humanity associated with
the love of his craft!&mdash;philanthropia and
philotechnia&mdash;the joy of working joined
in each one to a true love of his brother.
Memorable sentence indeed! in which for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
the first time was coined the magic word
&quot;philanthropy,&quot; and conveying the subtle
suggestion that perhaps in this combination
the longings of humanity may find
their solution, and Wisdom&mdash;<i>Philosophia</i>&mdash;at
last be justified of her children.</p>
